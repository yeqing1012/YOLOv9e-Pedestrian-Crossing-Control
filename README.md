📌 **Project Description**
   * The project focuses on automating pedestrian crossing control using a YOLO model to detect people.
   * The system helps security guards decide when to stop vehicles and allow pedestrians to cross safely.
   * To improve traffic management efficiency.
   * To assist security guards in controlling traffic more accurately.
  
🛠️  **Requirements**
   - Python 3.x
   - PyTorch 
   - YOLOv9e
   - OpenCV
   - Tkinter
   - A camera (optional)

🚀  **Notes**
   - "real_time.bat" is used for real-time detection and requires the use of a camera.
   - "video.bat" is used for video detection, you need to input the location of video file.
   - "detect.py" realizes area target detection.
   - Simulate the UI design map of a school road and implement traffic light signal changes based on what is detected.
